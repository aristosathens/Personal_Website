                I was born in San Antonio, Texas, and grew up in Houston, Texas.
                I moved to California in middle school and have been here ever since.
                My dad is Greek, from the island of Cyprus, and my mom is from the Midwest. 
                I speak English and Greek, and dabble in Spanish.

                I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford, and am currently working on an MS in the same department with a focus on robotics.
                I am interested in robotics, computer vision, and autonomous motion.
                I like to code in Go.
                I appreciate its enforcement of simple coding approaches and its fast compiler.
                I also use Python, and have experience with C and C#.

                This website was coded from scratch in Go, with some HTML and JS in front of it.
                I'm inexperienced with front end technologies, so please excuse any design flaws.
