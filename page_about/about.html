                I was born in San Antonio, Texas, and grew up in Houston, Texas.
                I moved to California in middle school and have been here ever since.
                My dad is Greek, from the island of Cyprus, and my mom is from the Midwest. 
                I speak English and Greek, and dabble in Spanish.

                I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford, and am currently working on an MS in the same department with a focus on robotics.
                I am interested in robotics, computer vision, and autonomous motion.
                While in grad school I discovered a passion for coding.
                When given the choice I like to code in Go.
                In particular, I love fast compiler, the lightweight threads (goroutines), and the enforcement of simple coding approaches.
                I am also adept at Python, and have experience with C and C#.

                This website was coded from scratch in Go, with some HTML and JS in front of it.
                I'm inexperienced with front end technologies, so please excuse any design flaws.
                In fact, if you have recommendations on how to improve this site (layout/aesthetics in particular), please contact me via the Contact page :)
