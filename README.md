This is the code for my personal website, hosted on Heroku (https://aristosathens.herokuapp.com/home/).

Server side is coded in Go. Front end uses Golang html templates to produce data-driven html (and js/css) output.

As of this writing I am experienced with Go, but new to all front end technologies.
